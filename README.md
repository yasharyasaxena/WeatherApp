# Weather APP

The task involves designing and implementing the front-end of a Weather Application. The application should allow users to search for a specific location and view current weather conditions. The main features include:

Welcoming Interface: Display a friendly message and a brief overview of the app's purpose. Include a search bar for users to input the desired location.
Weather API Integration: Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data. Ensure the API requests and responses are handled effectively.
Weather Details Display: Present key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the conditions (e.g., "clear sky" or "cloudy").
The focus is on creating a user-friendly, responsive front-end with accurate weather information retrieval.

I did the task using React and OpenWeatherMap API.
I also added the weather icons on the search results.
The website is hosted using Netlify on the URL `https://yasharyaweather.netlify.app/`

Right now the best viewing experience of the site is on desktop/laptop and the mobile view can be improved.
